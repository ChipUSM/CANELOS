		The continuous reduction trend of the electronic devices’ sizes over the past several decades has supported the growing demands for 
		improved performance as well as for increasing multifunctionality within a smaller form -factor- as anticipated by Gordon Moore in 1965. 
		2D materials -nowadays a rather large class of only a few atoms thin materials-, propelled by the seminal paper on graphene by Geim and Novoselov 
		in 2004 could further extend such trajectory. They are naturally the thinnest materials, intrinsically multifunctional, 
		and are available as semiconductors, semimetals and insulators. 2D materials have thus ushered us quickly towards an “era of surfaces”, 
		an uncharted territory for the semiconductor industry. Our conventional knowledge around surfaces, doping, defects and bandgap of a thin film 
		are all challenged, and making a technological choice only based on the pristine properties of a standalone 2D material would be unwise.

<p align="justify">
	After a short preamble about the use of semiconductor 2D materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) for advanced FETs, 
	we will explore some exciting applications of graphene as a multifunctional, dynamically tunable semimetal. In particular, 
	the harnessing of graphene’s properties on silicon wafers, despite inherent challenges, could deliver a broad range of miniaturized and 
	reconfigurable functionalities to complement CMOS technologies in a system with the smallest form-factor. Over the last decade, 
	my group pioneered an epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide on silicon technology able to fill this gap, in addition, unlocking unique 
	functionalities for MEMS/NEMS, nano-optics and metasurfaces thanks to the specific combination of graphene with silicon carbide. 
	This platform allows to realize any complex graphene nanopattern in a site – selective fashion, at the wafer -scale and with sufficient 
	adhesion for subsequent integration. We will review the fundamental hallmarks of this technology and some of its most promising applications 
	in areas as diverse as integrated energy storage, reconfigurable metasurfaces for MIR sensing and detection, and electrodes for 
	electro-encephalography for brain-computer interfaces.

		Despite the much debated end of Moore's Law, CMOS scaling still maintains economic relevance with 3nm finFET SoCs already in the marketplace 
		for three years and 2nm gate-all-around SoCs anticipated late this year. Area scaling extensively driven by design/technology innovations 
		co-optimized for primarily logic scaling continues to offer compelling node-to-node power, performance, area, and cost benefits. In this tutorial, 
		we will start with a walk through memory lane, recounting a brief history of transistor evolution to motivate the migration from the planar MOSFET 
		to the fully depleted FinFET. We will summarize the key process technology elements that have enabled the finFET CMOS nodes, highlighting the 
		resulting device technology characteristics and challenges. This will set the context for motivating the transition to the gate-all-around device 
		architecture, namely nanoribbons or nanosheets, and unveiling the magic of how these devices are fabricated.
